Just sketching out how to use the core functionality of s3r. Please feel free to reach out if you use this and have any feedback, much appreciated.

Formal or simplified environment designation. The **s3e** environment serves a crucial part in this package, storing you main bucket name, profile, local file path to serve as a cache, default aws arguments. The biggest improvement I hope this package will make on the typical operations with s3 paths is the designation of a working directory at s3e$cwd. This will allow you to list, move, copy, get, or put without using a fully qualified s3 name. By default cwd is set at the bucket root.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
s3_set(bucket = "s3r-test-bucket", profile = "s3r-read-write-user")
s3_ls()

df <- data.frame(col1 = c(1,2,3), col2=c(2,3,4))
s3_put_with(df, write.csv, "file.csv")
s3_ls()

```
